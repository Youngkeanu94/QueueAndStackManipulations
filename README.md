This C# program demonstrates the practical use of queues and stacks. In the first part, it uses a stack to reverse a user-input word, showing how to reverse sequences. In the second part, it uses a queue to manage a list of banking customers, implementing enqueue and dequeue operations to simulate a real-world scenario. The program also includes a function to reverse the order of words in a sentence using a stack.
